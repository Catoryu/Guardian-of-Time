Adventure Game where you play a character named "Kootta", you live his story.  
The game will be made in lua using a library named LOVE2D.

All characters are products of my imagination, feel free to contact me if you want to know more about the story or other things (I speak French, Portuguese, can speak English and try to learn Japanese OwO) :
